Scene Graph and User Interaction
	Procedural geometry was succusfully implemented into the room editor. We implemented a next and
	previous button with corresponding inputs for updating the transformations for each object allowing
	each one to	be edited in the program. Blinn-Phong lighting was also implemented successfully but we
	decided to keep high ambient light for testing purposes.

Catmull-Clark Subdivision
	We decided to implement a half-edge data structure for the Catmull-Clark Subdivision functionality.
	This way no other code had to be changed in our project to accomodate the algorithm. A face-list is
	passed to the algorithm which transforms it into a half-edge data structure, does its computations,
	and then returns a new updated facelist.

Raytracing
	Intersection testing, ray generation, and ray casting were all successfully implemented. We created
	a scenegraph function which goes through all its nodes recursively calculating the appropriate colors.
	All information necessary for the ray generation is in MyGLWidget, so ray generation is accomplished
	inside those files.
